Letter guessing game
The idea of the game is that there is a hidden word that the player tries to guess, one letter at a time. 
There is also a displayed word in which each letter in the hidden word is shown as a dash. 
If a correct letter is guessed, then those positions of the displayed word are filled in with the correct letter. 
There is a maximum number of guesses. 
(Traditionally, an incorrect guess results in a body part being added to a figure on a scaffold. If the figure is completed before the player guesses all the letters in the word, the player loses.)
